# Object Detection

## Overview
This project implements object detection using deep learning models. The goal is to identify and locate objects within an image or video stream.
```
## Features
- Detect multiple objects in images and videos
- Supports real-time detection
- Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models
- Customizable for specific object categories
```
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/manishkumar8312/object-detection.git
   cd object-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Detect objects in an image
```sh
python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

### Detect objects in a video
```sh
python detect.py --video path/to/video.mp4
```

### Real-time detection using webcam
```sh
python detect.py --webcam
```

## Model Options
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- Faster R-CNN
- SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)

## Configuration
Modify `config.py` to adjust detection settings, such as confidence threshold, input size, and model selection.

## Dataset
The project can be trained on custom datasets using the COCO format or other labeled datasets. Instructions for training are provided in `train.py`.

## Results
After running detection, results will be saved in the `output/` directory.
